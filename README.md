# Morichalion's Lazy Streamer Beat Saber Camera for LIV Avatars.

# Description
With this script selected, the camera will switch from a standard selfie-style camera behavior to a smooth, third-person camera set of behaviors when the streamer selects a 90 or 360 degree stage. Other features are planned, but that works well enough for me at the moment. 

Give me a heads up on what kind of features I should add. 

# Installation
1. Ensure that you have the sdkv2_compositor version of LIV installed.

2. Place the MoriBScam.dll in ~/Documents/LIV/Plugins/CameraBehaviours

3. Ensure that HTTP status is installed for Beat Saber. Over here: https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status

3. Run LIV, select Plugins -> 'Mori's Beat Saber Cam'.

4. Profit. 

# Configuration
The config file is created at ~Documents\LIV\Plugins\CameraBehaviours\MoriBScam\ini.txt on the first run of the plugin. Directions should be printed in a fairly easy-to-understand way.

The overlay and twitch integration is off by default.
